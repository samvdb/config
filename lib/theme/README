This directory contains themes used by several applications.

Each theme is a directory which collects application specific configuration
files that together make up a `style'. Each application is in charge of loading
the relevant theme file itself.

The current theme in use is symlinked to ./current

A typical directlry structure would be
./simple/ <-- a theme folder
./simple/tmux.conf <-- file containing tmux theme commands
./current -> ./simple <-- symlink pointing to the current theme
